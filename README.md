# USyd DATA1001 Projects Trilogy
Trilogy of projects made during the first year of my Data Science major

# **Project 1**
This project was made with the intention of analysing the trend of 2017 property prices in Newtown NSW

Data from Domain was collected/analysed and report was constructed through the use of the one and only RStudio

Data structure and limitations were conveyed with visual graphs (bar plots and line graphs)

4 research questions were tasked, along with an independent question of choice:
- What was the average price of a property?
- Does the amount of carspots affect the price?
- What were the cheapest properties?
- Assuming commission fees are around 2%, which agency earnt the most over that period?
- Does the number of bedrooms affect the price of properties? (independent)

Each question was analysed with results gained through R statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation etc.) alongside the implementation of tables and scatterplots

# **Project 2**
This project was primarily aiming to examine the impact of COVID-19 on both domestic and international students, along with factors such as working hours, financial support and online learning

Data was collected from a survey (Google Forms) provided to the 2020 Semester 1 cohort of DATA1001, along with external students from other cohorts and faculties

All research questions were of independent choice:
- How many hours (per week) do students work?
- Has working hours increased/decreased due to COVID-19?
- Does the financial support received due to COVID-19 differ between domestic and international students?
- Is there a relationship between the hours worked and the number of hours studied during COVID-19?
- Have the challenges of COVID-19 towards the quality of education received contributed to domestic and international student's consideration of deferring their studies?
- Do international students consider deferring studies more than domestic students?
