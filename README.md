Data from Domain was collected/analysed and report was constructed through the use of the one and only RStudio

- Does the number of bedrooms affect the price of properties? (independent)

Each question was analysed with results gained through R statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation etc.) alongside the implementation of tables and scatterplots
